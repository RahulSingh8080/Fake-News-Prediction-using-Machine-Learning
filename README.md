Fake News Detection Project

Introduction

The project aims to develop a machine-learning model capable of identifying and classifying any news article as fake or not. The distribution of fake news can potentially have highly adverse effects on people and culture. This project involves building and training a model to classify news as fake news or not using a diverse dataset of news articles. We have used four techniques to determine the results of the model.

Machine Learning Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Gradient Boost Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Project Overview

Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, where information spreads rapidly through various online platforms. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to automatically determine the authenticity of news articles, providing a valuable tool to combat misinformation.

Dataset

We have used a labeled dataset containing news articles along with their corresponding labels (true or false). The dataset is divided into two classes:

True: Genuine news articles

False: Fake or fabricated news articles

System Requirements

Hardware Requirements:

4GB RAM

i3 Processor

500MB free space

Software Requirements:

Anaconda

Python 3.x

Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries and packages installed:

Python 3

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Regular Expressions

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn re





Results

We evaluated each classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results are documented in the project files.

Model Deployment

Once you are satisfied with the performance of a particular classifier, you can deploy it in a real-world application or integrate it into a larger system for automatic fake news detection.
