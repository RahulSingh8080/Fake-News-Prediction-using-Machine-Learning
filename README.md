## Introduction

This project aims to develop a **machine-learning model** capable of identifying and classifying news articles as **fake** or **not fake**. The spread of fake news can have significant negative impacts on society, and this project seeks to mitigate misinformation using **ML algorithms**. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of news articles using multiple classification techniques.

### **Machine Learning Models Used:**
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Gradient Boost Classifier**
4. **Random Forest Classifier**

## Project Overview

Fake news is a major issue in today's digital era, where misinformation spreads rapidly. This project leverages ML algorithms to automatically determine the authenticity of news articles, providing a valuable tool in combating misinformation.

## Dataset

We have used a **labeled dataset** containing news articles categorized as:
- **True:** Genuine news articles
- **False:** Fake or fabricated news articles

## System Requirements 

### **Hardware Requirements:**
- Minimum **4GB RAM**
- **i3 Processor** or higher
- **500MB free storage space**

### **Software Requirements:**
- **Anaconda** (Recommended)
- **Python 3.x**

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Usage

### **1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RahulSingh8080/Fake-News-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
```

### **2. Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd Fake-News-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
```

### **3. Run the model script:**
```bash
python fake_news_detection.py
```

### **4. The model will:**
- Train on the dataset
- Evaluate its performance
- Predict whether the given news is **Fake** or **Not Fake**

## Results

Each classifier is evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**

The detailed results are documented in the project files.

## Model Deployment

Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for real-world applications like **news verification tools**, **fact-checking systems**, or **media monitoring solutions**.
